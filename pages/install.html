# Installing Luvit

Installing Luvit is a multi-step process currently.  But fear not, it's still quite simple.

## Get Lit

If you're on Linux, FreeBSD, or OSX, run the following command to download and package a `lit` binary for your platform:

```sh
curl -L https://github.com/luvit/lit/raw/master/get-lit.sh | sh
```

If you're on windows, run the sister command in your `cmd.exe` command prompt.

```bat
PowerShell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy unrestricted -Command "iex ((new-object net.webclient).DownloadString('https://github.com/luvit/lit/raw/master/get-lit.ps1'))"
```

## Make Luvit

Once you have lit, use it to build luvit.  This is the same for all platforms.

The latest published lit release of luvit can be built with:

```sh
lit make lit://luvit/luvit
```

If you'd rather test the master branch on github, use:

```sh
lit make github://luvit/luvit
```

Both these commands will create a `luvit` executable in the current directory.

Put both `lit` and `luvit` in your path somewhere.  We recommend `/usr/local/bin` or `$HOME/bin` if that's in your path.

To test your install run `luvit` to enter the repl.  This has readline-like capabilities implemented in lua and has tab completion of expressions for interactive exploring the runtime.

## Prebuilt Binaries

While the lit method is quick and easy, we're working on an even easier with pre-bundled `luvit` and `lit` binaries for popular platforms.

Watch this space for updates.

## Compile From Source

If you system is not one of the platforms for which we publish [pre-built luvi binaries](https://github.com/luvit/luvi/releases), you can still build lit from a manually compiled `luvi`.

This requires a C compiler such as gcc, clang, or Visual Studio.  You also need to have [cmake](http://www.cmake.org/) installed and in your path.

```sh
git clone --recursive https://github.com/luvit/luvi.git
cd luvi
make static
make test
```

The final binary will be at `build/luvi` on most platforms (cmake decides this path).  Once you have this, build lit manually using this luvi.


```sh
curl -L https://github.com/luvit/lit/archive/master.zip > lit.zip
LUVI_APP=lit.zip ./build/luvi make lit.zip
```

This will create a `lit` executable in your current directory.  Then you can continue to build luvit normally with:

```sh
lit make github://luvit/luvit
```

And put `lit` and `luvit` in your system path.
